# todo-react-webpack
Simple todo application built with React and Webpack with live reloading. It stores todos locally using the `localStorage` on browsers.

You are on the *vanilla* branch, which does not use Facebook's flux data pattern.

Built with [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate).

# Running
```
npm install
npm start
```
